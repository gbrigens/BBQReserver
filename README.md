# BBQReserver

The BBQ Reservation application is meant to be a replacement for the current system which is just a google form that allows anyone to make any change to the spread sheet. It requires you to check for the times and other details to avoid conflicts. This new application is meant to make reservation much easier and organized using a telegram bot. User would be able to reserve, edit or check for slots through the telegram bot. The bot does all the checking and validation on the spreadsheet and sends the user responses.
